Hi! I propose you an optional task (you are NOT required to implement it, but if you have some free time, you can try). Try to write code that will work in your group language (JavaScript under Node.js OR C# code ) and other language(s) as well (for example, Java). E.g. same file should output the string Itransition when run via:
1) node Task3.java
2) javac Task3.java && java Task3
or
1) dotnet run Task3.java
2) javac Task3.java && java Task3
(Note that file name is chosen in accordance with Java conventions, but file with the .java extension may contain JavaScript or anything you like; probably, your will need to change dotnet project settings to run .java file with the help of dotnet, however, you cannot create some.cs file runner/starter or put some code in this project file, etc.).

Again, this is an OPTIONAL task. If you have no idea how to do it, you can ignore it. It's not an important skill (it's in domain of the "mad skills", not "get job skills"). 
If you solve it, send the Dropbox link to the solution (or github or anything that does not require registation) and screenshot from terminal demonstrating script execution as Java as well as C# or JavaScript code to me (p.lebedev@itransition.com).

Of course, if you will be able to use 3 languages (Java + C# + JavaScript), it will be really cool (but try not to spend a lof of time, it can be not the easiest task).

NOTE: solution is a single file (Task3.java)
